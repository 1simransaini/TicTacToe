## How to Play?
- First player goes with X
- Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of the marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Result
- If X wins then PLAYER 1 is WINNER
- If O wins then PLAYER 2 is WINNER
- If none wins then DRAW
